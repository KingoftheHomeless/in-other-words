type Effect = (Type -> Type) -> Type -> Type

-- | An effect for collecting multiple effects into one effect.
--
-- Behind the scenes, 'Union' is the most important effect
-- in the entire library, as the 'Control.Effect.Carrier' class is built
-- around handling 'Union's of effects.
--
-- However, even outside of defining novel 'Control.Effect.Carrier' instances,
-- 'Union' can be useful as an effect in its own right.
-- 'Union' is useful for effect newtypes -- effects defined through creating a
-- newtype over an existing effect.
-- By making a newtype of 'Union', it's possible to wrap multiple effects in one
-- newtype.
--
-- Not to be confused with 'Control.Effect.Bundle'.
-- Unlike 'Control.Effect.Bundle', 'Union' is a proper effect that is given no
-- special treatment by 'Control.Effect.Eff' or 'Control.Effect.Effs'.
data Union (r :: [Effect]) m a where
  Union :: Coercible z m => ElemOf e r -> e z a -> Union r m a

-- | An @'Algebra' r m@ desribes a collection of effect handlers for @m@ over
-- all effects in the list @r@.
type Algebra r m = forall x. Union r m x -> m x

-- | A first-rank type which can often be used instead of 'Algebra'
type Algebra' r m a = Union r m a -> m a

-- | 'RepresentationalEff' is the constraint every effect is expected
-- to satisfy: namely, that any effect @e m a@ is representational in @m@,
-- which -- in practice -- means that no constraints are ever placed upon
-- @m@ within the definion of @e@, and that @m@ isn't present in
-- the return type of any action of @e@.
--
-- You don't need to make instances of 'RepresentationalEff'; the compiler
-- will automatically infer if your effect satisfies it.
--
-- 'RepresentationalEff' is not a very serious requirement, and
-- even effects that don't satisfy it can typically be rewritten into
-- equally powerful variants that do.
--
-- If you ever encounter that an effect you've written doesn't satisfy
-- 'RepresentationalEff', please consult
-- [the wiki](https://github.com/KingoftheHomeless/in-other-words/wiki/Advanced-topics#making-effects-representationaleff).

-- | @'Threads' t p@ is satisfied if @'ThreadsEff' t e@ instances are defined for

-- able to lift 'Algebra's over @p@ from any monad @m@ to @t m@. This is useful
-- when defining custom 'Control.Effect.Carrier.Carrier' instances.
--
-- Note that you /should not/ place a @'Threads' t p@ constraint if @t@ is
-- simply a newtype over an existsing monad transformer @u@ that already has
-- 'ThreadsEff' instances defined for it. Instead, you should place a
-- @'Threads' u p@ constraint, and use its 'thread' by coercing the resulting
-- algebra from @'Algebra' p (u m)@ to @'Algebra' p (t m)@'.
-- That way, you avoid having to define redundant 'ThreadsEff' instances for
-- every newtype of a monad transformer.
