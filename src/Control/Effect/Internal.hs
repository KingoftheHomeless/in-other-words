-- | The class of effect carriers, and the underlying mechanism with which
-- effects are implemented.
--
-- Each carrier is able to implement a number of /derived/ effects,
-- and /primitive/ effects. Users usually only interact with derived
-- effects, as these determine the effects that users have access to.
--
-- The standard interpretation tools are typically powerful enough to
-- let you avoid making instances of this class directly. If you need to make
-- your own instance of 'Carrier', import "Control.Effect.Carrier" and consult the
-- [wiki](https://github.com/KingoftheHomeless/in-other-words/wiki/Advanced-topics#novel-carriers).
class Monad m => Carrier m where
  -- | The derived effects that @m@ carries. Each derived effect is eventually
  -- reformulated into terms of the primitive effects @'Prims' m@ or other
  -- effects in @'Derivs' m@.
  --
  -- In application code, you gain access to effects by placing membership
  -- constraints upon @'Derivs' m@. You can use 'Eff' or 'Effs' for this
  -- purpose.
  --
  -- Although rarely relevant for users, @'Derivs' m@ can also contain effects
  -- that aren't expressed in terms of other effects, as longs as the handlers
  -- for those effects can be lifted generically using 'lift'. Such effects don't
  -- need to be part of @'Prims' m@, which is exclusively for primitive effects
  -- whose handlers need special treatment to be lifted.
  --
  -- For example, first order effects such as 'Control.Effect.State.State'
  -- never need to be part of @'Prims' m@. Certain higher-order effects -
  -- such as 'Control.Effect.Cont.Cont' - can also be handled such that they
  -- never need to be primitive.
  type Derivs m :: [Effect]

  -- | The primitive effects that @m@ carries. These are higher-order effects
  -- whose handlers aren't expressed in terms of other effects, and thus need to

  --
  -- __Never place membership constraints on @'Prims' m@.__
  -- You should only gain access to effects by placing membership constraints
  -- on @'Derivs' m@.
  --
  -- /However/, running interpreters may place other kinds of constraints upon
  -- @'Prims' m@, namely /threading constraints/, marked by the use of
  -- 'Threaders'.
  -- If you want to run such an effect interpreter inside application code, you
  -- have to propagate such threading constraints through your application.
  --
  -- @'Prims' m@ should only contain higher-order effects that can't be lifted
  -- generically using 'lift'. Any other effects can be placed in @'Derivs' m@.

  algPrims :: Algebra' (Prims m) m a

  -- | Any 'Carrier' @m@ must provide a way to describe the derived effects it
  -- carries in terms of the primitive effects.
  --
  -- 'reformulate' is that decription: given any monad @z@ such that
  -- @z@ lifts @m@, then a @z@-based 'Algebra' (i.e. effect handler)
  -- over the derived effects can be created out of a @z@-based 'Algebra' over
  -- the primitive effects.

--
-- Unlike 'Member', 'Eff' gives 'Bundle' special treatment.
-- As a side-effect, 'Eff' will get stuck if @e@ is a type variable.

deriving via (m :: * -> *) instance Carrier m => Carrier (IdentityT m)

-- | A constraint that @'Prims' m@ satisfies all the constraints in the list
-- @cs@.
--
-- This is used for /threading constraints/.
--
-- Every interpreter that relies on an underlying
-- non-trivial monad transformer -- such as 'Control.Effect.State.runState',
-- which uses 'Control.Monad.Trans.State.Strict.StateT' internally --
-- must be able to lift all primitive effect handlers of the monad it's transforming
-- so that the resulting transformed monad can also handle the primitive effects.
--
-- The ability of a monad transformer to lift handlers of a particular
-- primitive effect is called /threading/ that effect. /Threading constraints/
-- correspond to the requirement that the primitive effects of the monad that's
-- being transformed can be thread by certain monad transformers.
--
-- For example, the 'Control.Effect.State.runState' places the threading
-- constraint 'Control.Effect.State.StateThreads' on @'Prims' m@, so that
-- @'Control.Effect.State.StateC' s m@ can carry all primitive effects that
-- @m@ does.
--
-- 'Threaders' is used to handle threading constraints.
-- @'Threaders' '['Control.Effect.State.StateThreads', 'Control.Effect.Error.ExceptThreads'] m p@
-- allows you to use 'Control.Effect.State.runState' and
-- 'Control.Effect.Error.runError' with the carrier @m@.
--
-- Sometimes, you may want to have a local effect which you interpret
-- inside of application code, such as a local 'Control.Effect.State.State'
-- or 'Control.Effect.Error.Error' effect. In such cases, /try to use/
-- [split interpretation](https://github.com/KingoftheHomeless/in-other-words/wiki/Advanced-Topics#abstract-effect-interpretation) /instead of using interpreters with threading constraints/
-- /inside of application code./ If you can't, then using 'Threaders'
-- is necessary to propagate the threading constraints
-- throughout the application.
--
-- __The third argument @p@ should always be a polymorphic type variable, which__
-- __you can simply provide and ignore.__
-- It exists as a work-around to the fact that many threading constraints
-- /don't actually work/ if they operate on @'Prims' m@ directly, since
-- threading constraints often involve quantified constraints, which are fragile
-- in combination with type families -- like 'Prims'.
--
-- So @'Threaders' '['Control.Effect.State.StateThreads'] m p@
-- doesn't expand to @'Control.Effect.State.StateThreads' ('Prims' m)@, but rather,
-- @(p ~ 'Prims' m, 'Control.Effect.State.StateThreads' p)@
